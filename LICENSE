                     GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                        Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                             Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works. This license is intended to guarantee
your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure
it remains free software for all its users. This General Public License
applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any
other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software
Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License
instead.)

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service
if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs,
and that you are informed that you can do these things.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' sake, the GPL ensures that everyone else
is also granted these freedoms. For example, if you distribute copies of
such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on the same
freedoms to the recipients. You must make sure that they, too, receive or
can get the source code. And you must tell them their rights.

  Developers and authors who use the GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must pass on the same freedoms to the recipients. You
must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you
must tell them their rights.

  Developers and authors who use the GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.
